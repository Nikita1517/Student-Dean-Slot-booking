<h1>Design and Implementation of a Secure University Session Booking System</h1>

<h1>Description</h1> 

In an era of technological advancement, universities seek efficient solutions to manage and schedule academic sessions with students and deans. To address this need, our project focuses on the design and implementation of a secure University Session Booking System, an API-driven platform that streamlines session scheduling, ensures secure authentication, and enhances administrative processes. With a dynamic scheduling feature to accommodate multiple deans, this system aims to revolutionize how universities manage their sessions.

<h1>Project Objectives:</h1>

Our project has the following key objectives:

1. **Authentication and Security:** Implement a secure token-based authentication system to ensure that only authorized users access the system. Incorrect authentication attempts should lead to API failures, safeguarding sensitive data.

2. **Student Interaction:** Develop APIs that allow students to authenticate, view available sessions, and book slots conveniently. Students should have easy access to session information and the ability to book slots seamlessly.

3. **Dean Interaction:** Create APIs that enable deans to authenticate, view pending sessions, and efficiently manage them. Deans should have access to all necessary information to ensure smooth session management.

4. **Dynamic Scheduling:** Implement a dynamic scheduling system to accommodate multiple deans, each with their unique weekly availability. This feature ensures flexibility and scalability for universities with varying dean schedules.

5. **Submission and Documentation:** Prepare a comprehensive video presentation that includes a Postman demonstration, an explanation of the codebase, insights into database structures, and a showcase of actual data in the database. This documentation ensures effective communication of the project's progress and outcomes.
